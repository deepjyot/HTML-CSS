        <p>
            After all the battles we fought together, after all the difficult times we saw together, and after all the good and bad moments we’ve been through, I think it’s time I let you know how I <strong>feel</strong> about you.
        </p>
        <h2>
            You are the light of my life
        </h2>
        <p>
            You complete my darkness with your light. I love: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>the way you see good in the worse</li>
            <li>the way you handle emotionally difficult situations</li>
            <li>the way you look at Justice</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            I have learned a lot from you. You have occupied a <em>special</em> place in my heart over the time.
        </p>
